# Installation of a Widget

You can install your widget using the app's main window by clicking the `add widget` button. This action will automatically install your widget with a preset configuration. After installation, you can modify the configuration as needed.

Alternatively, you can manually move your created widget folder to the `electron-widgets` folder located in your Documents directory. Once the widget folder is placed there, you'll need to add your own configuration to the "widgets.json" file.

Both methods offer flexibility in installing and configuring widgets, allowing you to customize their behavior according to your preferences.
