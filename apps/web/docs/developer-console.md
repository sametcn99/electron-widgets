# Developer Console

To open the developer console in browser windows, you can usually focus the window and press the `F12` key or `CTRL + Shift + I`. This will open the developer tools panel where you can navigate to the "Console" tab to access the JavaScript console. From there, you can interact with the webpage, execute JavaScript code, and view console logs and errors.

Using the developer console can significantly streamline the development process and help you build and debug web applications more effectively.
