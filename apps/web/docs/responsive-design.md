# Responsive Design

Designing responsive widgets is crucial to ensure a seamless user experience across various screen sizes and resolutions. Here are some best practices to follow when designing responsive widgets for the Widget Windows Utility:

1. **Flexible Layouts:** Use relative units like percentages instead of fixed units like pixels. This allows the widget to resize according to the window size.

2. **Media Queries:** Use media queries to apply different styles for different screen sizes. This can help you adjust the layout, font size, and other design elements based on the screen size.

3. **Scalable Images:** Ensure that your images can scale without distortion. You can use CSS properties like `max-width`, `height: auto;` to make images responsive.

4. **Testing:** Test your widget on various screen sizes to ensure it looks and functions as expected. You can use the browser's developer tools to simulate different screen sizes.

Remember, the goal of responsive design is to make your widget look and function well on any screen size. By following these best practices, you can create a widget that provides a great user experience regardless of the device or screen size.
