Lastly, I want <strong>feedback</strong> on these changes and the subreddit in general and invite you to <strong>vote</strong> and <strong>use the report button</strong> when you see posts that violate the rules because they&#39;ll help us get to it faster.</p> <p><a href=\"/r/programming\">r/programming</a>&#39;s mission is to <strong>be the place with the highest quality programming content, where I can go to read something interesting and learn something new every day</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/173viwj/meta_the_future_of_rprogramming/\">Last time we spoke</a> I introduced the rules that we&#39;ve been moderating by to accomplish that. Subjectively, quality on the subreddit while not perfect is much improved since then. Since it&#39;s still mainly just me moderating it&#39;s hard to tell what&#39;s objectively bad vs what just annoys me personally, and to do that I&#39;ve been keeping an eye on a few forms of content to see how they perform (using mostly votes and comment quantity &amp; health).</p> <p>Based on that the notable changes are:</p> <ul> <li>üö´ <strong>Listicles</strong>. &quot;7 cool python functions&quot;, &quot;14 ways to get promoted&quot;. These are usually spammy content farms. If you found 15 amazing open source projects that will blow my mind, post those projects instead.</li> <li>üö´ <strong>Extreme beginner content</strong> (&quot;how to write a for loop&quot;). This is difficult to identify objectively (how can you tell it from good articles like &quot;how does kafka work?&quot; or &quot;getting started with linear algebra for ML&quot;?) so there will be some back and forth on calibrating, but there has been a swath of very low quality <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1chogwb/first_program_of_java/\">&quot;tutorials&quot;</a> if you can even call them that, that I very much doubt anybody is actually learning anything from and they sit at 0 points. Since &quot;what is a variable?&quot; is probably not useful to anybody already reading <a href=\"/r/programming\">r/programming</a> this is a quick painless way to boost the average quality on the subreddit.</li> <li>‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Career posts must be related to software engineering careers</strong>. To be honest I&#39;m personally not a fan of career posts on <a href=\"/r/programming\">r/programming</a> at all (but shout out to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/\">cscareerquestions</a>!) but during the last rules revision they were doing pretty well so I know there is an audience for it that I don&#39;t want to get in the way of. Since then there has been growth in this category <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/domain/eng-leadership.com/\">all across the quality spectrum</a> (with an accompanying rise in product management methodology like &quot;agile vs waterfall&quot;, also across the quality spectrum). Going forward these posts must be distinctly related to software engineering careers rather than just generic working. This isn&#39;t a huge problem yet but I predict that it will be as the percentage of career content is growing.</li> </ul> <p>In all of these cases the category is more of a tell that the quality is probably low, so exceptions will be made where that&#39;s not the case. These are difficult categories to moderate by so I&#39;ll <strong>probably make some mistakes</strong> on the boundaries and that&#39;s okay, let me know and we&#39;ll figure it out.</p> <p>Some other categories that I&#39;m <strong>keeping an eye on</strong> but not ruling on today are:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Corporate blogs</strong> simply describing their product in the guise of &quot;what is an authorisation framework?&quot; (I&#39;m <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/domain/a0.to/\">looking at you Auth0</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1cgx739/what_is_ai_infrastructure_software/\">others like it</a>). Pretty much anything with a rocket ship emoji in it. Companies use their blogs as marketing, branding, and recruiting tools and that&#39;s okay when it&#39;s &quot;writing a good article will make people think of us&quot; but it doesn&#39;t go here if it&#39;s just a literal advert. Usually they are titled in a way that I don&#39;t spot them until somebody reports it or mentions it in the comments.</li> <li><strong>Generic AI content</strong> that <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1chll2o/ai_still_hasnt_figured_out_branding_yet_heres_why/\">isn&#39;t</a> technical in content. &quot;Does Devin mean that programming is over?&quot;, &quot;Will AI put farmers out of work?&quot;, &quot;Is AI art?&quot;. For a few weeks these were the titles of about 20 articles per day, some scoring high and some low. Fashions like this come and go but I&#39;m keeping an eye on it.</li> <li><strong>Newsletters</strong>: There are a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1cho9ye/big_tech_digest_15_introducing_meta_llama_3_at/\">few people</a> that post every edition of their newsletter to reddit, where that newsletter is really just aggregating content from elsewhere. It&#39;s clear that they are trying to grow a monetised audience using reddit, but that&#39;s okay if it&#39;s providing valuable curation or if the content is good and people like it. So we&#39;ll see.</li> <li><strong>Career posts</strong>. Personally I&#39;d like <a href=\"/r/programming\">r/programming</a> to be a deeply technical place but as mentioned there&#39;s clearly an audience for career advice.

That tells me that there&#39;s some subtlety to why these posts are scoring well and I&#39;m keeping an eye on the category. What I don&#39;t want is for &quot;vote up if you want free snacks&quot; to push out the good stuff or to be a farm for the other 90% of content that&#39;s really just personal brand builders.</li> </ul> <p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;re as annoyed as I am about these but they&#39;re fuzzy lines and difficult to come up with objective criteria around.
